## Overview
This is a simple 2D game in which the player is a blue circle and must collect all the yellow balls before proceeding to the finish zone. Each level progresses by adding an additional black ball that must be avoiding

## Purpose
This project was made to practice the concepts learned in the free [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) textbook. The jumping off point for this project comes from [chapter 16](https://eloquentjavascript.net/16_game.html) where the author makes their own 2D game using the canvas element. This project is organized similarly to the one found in the linked chapter and some of the code is re-used.
